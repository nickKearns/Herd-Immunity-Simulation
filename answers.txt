What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
What percentage of the population died from the virus?
Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?


1.)I gave the simulation the population size of 1000, percent vaccinated was 50%, the virus was named ebola,
 the mortality rate was 50%, the reproduction rate was 25% and the number of initial infected people was 10

2.) At the peak of the infection 35.5% of the population was infected.
3.) 26.7% of the population died from the virus
4.)I do not have an exact number but there was definitely tens of thousands of interactions where a vaccination saved a person from becoming infected.
